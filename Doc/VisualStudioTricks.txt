To clean-up your solution directory (getting rid of ipch, sdf, suo, etc...):
	Go to Tools->Options->TextEditor->C/C++->Advanced
	Under Fallback Location set "Always Use Fallback Location" to True while leaving "Fallback Location" empty
	This makes VS pick a temp location to store these files
	It'll prompt you about this every run (unless you check the "don't remind me" button)
	
To see who is including what right click on a C++ file and go to C/C++->Advanced and turn on Show Includes
	When you compile you should get a hierarchical set of includes (hierarchy is denoted by tabs)
	Do note that VS is bad about noticing this flag changed so you have to modify the file before any changes take effect (both turning on/off the flag)
